# Emotion-Recognition-Sentiment-Analysis

The proposed system identifies the following sentiments:

1) Sleepy: When the EAR (ear aspect ratio) is less than a threshold, we detect that the person is
sleepy as his/her eyelids are dropping.

2) Happy (Smiling): When the MAR (mouth aspect ratio) is increased beyond a threshold, we detect
that the person is smiling hence, the person is happy.

3) Confused: When the person raises his/her eyebrows the ratio between the eyebrows and eye is
calculated and if it gets increased beyond a threshold, we determine that the person is confused
